🧩 Custom Python ETL Data Connector — SSN College (Software Architecture Assignment)
🎓 Course: Software Architecture
💻 Project: Building Custom Python ETL Data Connectors

📘 Project Overview

This project implements a custom Python ETL (Extract–Transform–Load) pipeline that connects to a public API, retrieves data, processes it for compatibility, and loads it into a MongoDB collection.

The project emphasizes software architecture principles, secure authentication, data validation, and modular design using Python.

🏗️ ETL Workflow

1. Extract

Connect to the selected API using the base URL and authentication headers.

Fetch data using the appropriate endpoint(s).

Handle rate limits, pagination, and response errors gracefully.

2. Transform

Clean, normalize, and reformat JSON data for MongoDB compatibility.

Add ingestion timestamps and remove unwanted fields.

Handle missing or inconsistent records.

3. Load

Connect to MongoDB using PyMongo.

Insert transformed data into a collection named:
<connector_name>\_raw

Ensure safe insertion and verify record counts.

🔒 Secure Authentication

All sensitive credentials (e.g., API keys, tokens, MongoDB URI) are stored in a .env file.

.env is not committed to the repository (added in .gitignore).

Credentials are loaded using the python-dotenv
library.

Example .env file:

API_KEY=your_api_key_here
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
BASE_URL=https://api.example.com

🧰 Technologies Used
Component Technology
Programming Language Python 3.x
API Interaction requests
Environment Handling python-dotenv
Database MongoDB
Database Driver pymongo
Error Handling & Logging Built-in Python logging
Testing Manual and script-based validation
🧩 Example API Connector

For demonstration, assume we use the OpenWeatherMap API to extract weather data.

Base URL:

https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather

Example Endpoint:

GET /data/2.5/weather?q=Chennai&appid=YOUR_API_KEY

Sample Output (Transformed):

{
"city": "Chennai",
"temperature": 303.15,
"weather": "Clear",
"timestamp": "2025-10-15T12:30:00Z"
}

🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone the Repository
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/SSN-college-software-architecture-Assignments.git
   cd SSN-college-software-architecture-Assignments
   git checkout -b <your-branch-name>

2. Install Dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a .env file with your API and MongoDB credentials.

4. Run the ETL Script
   python etl_connector.py

5. Verify MongoDB Collection

Open MongoDB and check if data is inserted in the collection:

<connector_name>\_raw

🧪 Testing & Validation

✅ Validates successful API response (status 200)
✅ Handles empty or invalid payloads
✅ Manages pagination and rate limits
✅ Ensures MongoDB insertion success
✅ Adds ingestion timestamp for each record
✅ Logs all key events (success/failure)
